In this context, a vector is either an array of numbers or nested arrays of arrays of numbers. All non-numeric data types, such as categories, like `normalizeHolidayName`, `isPaidTimeOff` in the dataframe are eventually represented as numbers. Also, for numerical categories, such as `day_of_week` and `month_num`, it is important to encode them. Otherwise, machine learning model might assume that month 6 (June) is six times as much as the month 1 (January).\n\n**One Hot Encoding** is often the recommended approach to encode categorical features. In this approach, for each categorical column, a number of N new columns are added to the data set, where N is the cardinality (the number of distinct values) of the column. Each column corresponds to one of the categories and will have a value of 0 if the row has that category or 1 if it hasn’t."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Run the following cell to encode the categorical features in the dataset using One Hot encoding.
